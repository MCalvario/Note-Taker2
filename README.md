# Note-Taker

## Description
As a full-stack developer, I want to create a note-taking app where a user is able to write and save notes so that he/she can organize his/her thoughts and keep track of tasks that need to be completed.

# Usage
To use this note-taking application, simply open the Note Taker.  You will be presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page.  When you click on the link to the notes page, you will be presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column.  When you enter a new note title and the note’s text, a "Save Note" button and a "Clear Form" button appear in the navigation at the top of the page.  When you click on the Save button, the new note that you have entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes and the buttons in the navigation disappear.  When you click on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column,  that note appears in the right-hand column and a "New Note" button appears in the navigation
If you click on the "New Note" button in the navigation at the top of the page, you will be presented with empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column and the button disappears.
